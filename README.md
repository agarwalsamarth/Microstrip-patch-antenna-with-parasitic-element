# Microstrip-patch-antenna-with-parasitic-element
## Basic Idea
We have used a parasitic element in the microstrip patch antenna, in order to increase the bandwidth, to be used for 4G communication.Here we have compared both antenna's, one with parasitic element and one without it.
## Observation
Bandwidth is significantly increased by 270 MHz 
## How to run
Open the "End2.hfss" and "End3.hfss file through ansys HFSS software and run it.
